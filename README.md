🏛️ AR-Based Museum Tour

Democratizing cultural heritage through Web-based Augmented Reality

📌 Problem Statement

Traditional museums often struggle to engage younger, tech-savvy audiences.
Physical artifacts are usually locked behind glass, limiting interaction, scale perception, and immersive understanding. Additionally, access to world-class museums is restricted by geography, cost, and physical limitations.

💡 Our Solution

AR-Based Museum Tour is a web-based Augmented Reality platform that brings museum artifacts directly into a user’s physical space using only a smartphone browser.

Built with React, Three.js, and AR.js, the platform enables users to view, explore, and interact with high-quality 3D historical artifacts—anytime, anywhere—without installing an app.
